I have been teaching various courses at the universities of Freiburg i. Br. (D) and Basel (CH) at all levels and in different formats. 
An ovierview over my teaching in Basel can be found [here](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/de/vorlesungsverzeichnis?periode=all&keyword=ina+cathrin+serif&z51=&search=1#searchResults).
Since 2020, I have been focusing more and more on teaching computational methods to (PhD) students at the history department in Basel. 
While some courses were more centered around the use of specific software, others started with learning a programming language (R or Python) as a basis for the creation of a semester project, focusing on a historical research question.
Here you can look at some of the projects:
