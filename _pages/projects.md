Here is an overview of some of my current projects.

- ### digital representation of the *Konstanzer Jahrgeschichten*

[Here](https://wissen-ist-acht.github.io/Konstanzer_Jahrgeschichten/) you can find a collection of transcriptions from manuscripts that contain the so-called *Konstanzer Jahrgeschichten*.  
The number of entries and their length and dating differ from manuscript to manuscript, and these can now be compared. 
The corresponding XML-TEI files can be found [here](https://github.com/wissen-ist-acht/Konstanzer_Jahrgeschichten/tree/main/manuscripts).

- ### llm benchmarking for humanities data

As part of my activity at [RISE](rise.unibas.ch), I am contributing to benchmarks that assess the performance of large language models (LLMs) on humanities-related tasks.
The (fraktur benchmark)[https://rise-unibas.github.io/humanities_data_benchmark/benchmarks/fraktur/] evaluates a segmentation and transcription task using digitised images of an early modern newspaper.
The medieval manuscript benchmark assesses the performance of llms in transcribing medieval handwriting.
