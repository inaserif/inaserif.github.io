Here is an overview of some of my current projects.

- ### digital representation of the *Konstanzer Jahrgeschichten*

[Here](https://wissen-ist-acht.github.io/Konstanzer_Jahrgeschichten/) you can find a collection of transcriptions from manuscripts that contain the so-called *Konstanzer Jahrgeschichten*.  
The number of entries and their length and dating differ from manuscript to manuscript, and these can now be compared. 
The corresponding XML-TEI files can be found [here](https://github.com/wissen-ist-acht/Konstanzer_Jahrgeschichten/tree/main/manuscripts).

- ### 	The Quest for the Holy Entity: Using LLMs for Entity Recognition in Medieval Texts

Using medieval pilgrimage reports as sample, I am creating a pipeline for recognition, extraction and verification of entities, such as persons, places, organisations asf. 
Besides the technical work, a paper that discusses challenges and potentials and contains content-related analysis is in progress.

- ### llm benchmarking for humanities data

As part of my activity at [RISE](rise.unibas.ch), I am contributing to benchmarks that assess the performance of large language models (LLMs) on humanities-related tasks.

The [medieval manuscript benchmark](https://rise-unibas.github.io/humanities_data_benchmark/benchmarks/medieval_manuscripts/) assesses the performance of llms in transcribing medieval handwriting.

The [fraktur benchmark](https://rise-unibas.github.io/humanities_data_benchmark/benchmarks/fraktur/) evaluates a segmentation and transcription task using digitised images of an early modern newspaper.
