I am a historian focusing on medieval and early modern european history, employing computational methods to research when it seems suitable and finding joy in automating the boring stuff.

I am interested in ways of disseminating and preserving knowledge, in the history of knowledge, in book history, urban historiography, wissens- und gebrauchsliteratur and digital humanities. 
I am currently employed at the University Basel as a postdoc for premodern and digital history. 
I am also part of the team of [RISE](https://rise.unibas.ch/en/), supporting humanities researchers with computer-based research, data creation and analysis, and data dissemination.

On these pages, you can find overview of some projects I am currently working on, and a list of digital resources I created that might prove useful for others.  
You can also find an overview of my teaching, with a focus on digital history, and a commented selection of some of my publications.
