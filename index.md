I am a historian focusing on (late) medieval and early modern european history, employing computational methods to research when it seems suitable and finding joy in automating the boring stuff.
I am currently employed at the University Basel as a postdoc for premodern and digital history. 

on these pages, you can find an overview of my teaching, with a focus on digital history, and a commented selection of some of my publications.
you can also find some digital resources I created that might prove useful for others, as well as an overview of some current projects.
